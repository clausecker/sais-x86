sais-x86
========

Sais-x86 is an implementation of the IS (induced sorting) suffix array
construction algorithm in x86-64 assembly for systems following the
SysV ABI.

This implementation seems to be about 15% faster than sais-lite due to
various small optimisations.  I expect further performance improvements
to occur by vectorising the code, but I have not gotten around doing
that so far.

Sais-x86 is based on sais-lite 2.4.1 by Yuta Mori <yuta.256@gmail.com>

The SA-IS algorithm was first described in:

Ge Nong, Sen Zhang, and Wai Hong Chang: "Two Efficient Algorithms for
Linear Suffix Array Construction", IEEE Transactions on Computers,
vol. 60(10), p. 1471--1484, Oct. 2011.
